## How to Create GitHub page:
1. Create a public repository on GitHub
2. Using the terminal, clone the repository
```
git clone [WEB URL OF GITHUB REPOSITORY]
```
3. Enter the project folder & edit/create index.html and styles.css files
```
cd [FOLDER/REPOSITORY NAME]
code index.html // this will open an index.html file in vscode
code styles.css
```
4. After creating the site, add, commit & push your changes
```
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```
5. Enable GitHub Pages
    - Go to your repository's settings
    - Click Pages on the left side
    - Under Branch, select main, then click Save
    - After saving, GitHub will provide a link to your live website.

## Key Takeaways:
I learned that web development takes a long time to do. Designing the site & figuring out what to put first really helps in streamlining the process of coding this site. Even so, it still took hours to create a basic site using HTML & CSS.
